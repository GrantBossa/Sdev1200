'''
A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent of the propertyï¿½s actual value. 
If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000. 
The property tax is then $0.75 for each $100 of the assessment value. 
The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $45.00. 
Write a GUI program that displays the assessment value and property tax when a user enters the actual value of a property. '
